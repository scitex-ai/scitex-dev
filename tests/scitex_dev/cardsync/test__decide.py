"""The reconciliation decision, tested without a database.

Every case here is one the live fleet actually produced on 2026-08-10 while
two card stores were reconciled by hand. The two same-timestamp completions
in particular are not hypothetical: each host had completed a DIFFERENT
card, and last-writer-wins was blind to both because completion does not
bump ``last_activity``.

The UNRESOLVED tests matter most. A reconciler that always returns a side
looks decisive and silently reverts somebody's work.
