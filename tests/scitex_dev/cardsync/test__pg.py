"""The PostgreSQL card store: what it reads, and that it refuses to write.

No database and no mock. The row-to-card projection is a pure function, so
it is called with real rows; the write refusal is a real call to the real
method, and the two helpers below turn the raised exception into a value so
each test can carry exactly one assertion.

What is NOT covered here is the psycopg round-trip itself. That needs a live
store, and saying so is better than a fake that would agree with whatever
the real driver did.
