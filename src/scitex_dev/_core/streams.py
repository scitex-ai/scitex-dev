"""Caller-owned stream writes — the PS-220 content-transport primitive.

PS-220 forbids a bare ``print`` in shippable SciTeX source because a caller
importing the module cannot silence, redirect or capture it: there is no flag,
no handler and no level. The rule spares exactly three *mechanically provable*
transports, and one of them is a **caller-owned required stream** — a ``print``
whose ``file=`` is a REQUIRED parameter of the enclosing function, so the
CALLER, not this module, owns the destination.

``write_stream`` is that transport, factored out so the call sites that must
honour a caller-supplied stream (a captured ``io.StringIO`` in tests, a
redirected CLI stream, a cron job's own log sink) do not each re-derive it.
The stream is a REQUIRED parameter: this module never chooses a destination, so
nothing here is "library code writing unconditionally to stdout".

This is deliberately NOT a general ``print`` escape hatch. Routing a
caller-directed payload through a logger would be wrong, not merely noisy:
scitex-logging writes every console record to STDERR, which would corrupt a
machine-readable payload the caller asked to receive on its own stream.

    outputs whose exact bytes are a published contract — ``scitex-dev
    --version`` (pinned by tests and parsed by the fleet), a shell completion
    script that gets ``source``d — where a logging level prefix or a hop to
    stderr would corrupt the payload rather than clarify it.

    It is NOT a general ``print`` hatch: human-facing status and diagnostics

    Rich's ``Console.print`` is forbidden in shippable source (PS-220) and has
    no spare path: it always writes to a console stream that carries no level,
    no aligned prefix and no searchable record. So the renderable (a ``Table``,
    a markup string) is rendered with Rich's own renderer to text — the console
    stream is never written to — and that text is emitted as ONE levelled
    record. The table a reader sees is byte-identical; the operator gains the
    level.

    Parameters
    ----------
    renderable : Any
        Any Rich renderable: ``rich.table.Table``, markup ``str``, …
    name : str
        Logger name — pass ``__name__`` from the call site.

    stream : TextIO
        The caller-supplied destination. Required, so the destination is never
