"""Version ordering — a PEP 440 subset, deliberately strict, honest on giving up.

Zero third-party dependencies on purpose. This code can run on every CLI
invocation (via the cached-warning path) and inside a cron alarm that must
keep working on a host whose package is *too old to fix itself*. A hard
import of ``packaging`` is a way for the staleness alarm to be taken out by
the very staleness it exists to report.

The contract every function here keeps: **an input it does not fully
understand returns ``None``, never a guess.** ``None`` propagates to
:attr:`Currency.UNKNOWN`, which is silent. A comparator that guesses wrong
in the "fresh" direction hides a real outage; one that guesses wrong in the
"stale" direction cries wolf until it is disabled. Both end with nobody
trusting the alarm, so neither is permitted.

(Extracted verbatim in spirit from sac ``_freshness._version``; the module
is domain-neutral already.)
