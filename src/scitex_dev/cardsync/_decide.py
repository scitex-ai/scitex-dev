"""Which side of a two-store disagreement wins, and WHY — a pure function.

A BRIDGE, WITH AN EXIT CONDITION
--------------------------------
This exists because the card store does not use :mod:`scitex_dev.store`. It
has no oplog, so directed replay has nothing to replay, and three hosts
holding one logical board drift apart with nothing to reconcile them. On
2026-08-10 that drift reached 2,341 differing rows across two hosts and was
closed by hand.

When scitex-cards adopts the primitive, DELETE THIS MODULE. Reconciling a
foreign schema from outside is strictly worse than an oplog: it can only
compare end states, so it cannot distinguish "never sent" from "deleted",
which is the exact ambiguity the primitive was built to remove. Keeping two
reconcilers alive would also violate SSoT. This one is a stopgap that must
lose its reason to exist.

WHY A PURE FUNCTION
-------------------
Every dangerous decision in reconciliation is this one choice, and it is
worth testing without a database, a host, or a network. The I/O around it
is mechanical; this is where data gets destroyed.

THE THREE-VALUED RULE
---------------------
The outcome is not "A or B". It is A, B, or UNRESOLVED — and collapsing
UNRESOLVED into either pole is how a reconciler silently picks wrong. On
2026-08-10 two cards landed exactly there: each host had COMPLETED a
different card, and completion does not bump ``last_activity``, so
last-writer-wins was blind to both. They were resolvable only by a second
signal, and had the code guessed instead of flagging, one completion would
have been reverted with no trace.
