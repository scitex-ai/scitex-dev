# Changelog

All notable changes to `scitex-dev` are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `scitex-dev ecosystem write-ci-workflow <pkg>` — materialises the canonical
  `.github/workflows/audit.yml` inside a package's local checkout. The
  generated workflow runs `audit-all` on every push and PR, with no
  `continue-on-error`; failure is driven by the audit-all exit code.
- `scitex_dev._ecosystem._core.should_skip_audit(pkg, auditor)` — single
  source of truth for "does this auditor apply to this package?". Each
  auditor consults it on entry and emits `skip pkg: <reason>` when the
  package's category doesn't apply.

### Changed
- **Audit rule severities promoted `warn` → `error`.** Per the 2026-05-06
  directive, every actionable rule with a documented spec now defaults to
  `error` severity (CI must fail). 38 project rules + 11 CLI/MCP § sections
  promoted in one sweep. Rules can be demoted back to `warn` only after a
  documented false positive lands on develop.
- **Audit exit codes now reflect actual severity.** `run_audit`,
  `run_audit_mcp`, and the `*_all` variants now return `1` whenever any
  violation reaches `error` severity (warnings alone exit `0`,
  not-auditable exits `2`). Previously every audit returned `0` regardless
  of violations, hiding ecosystem-wide drift from CI.
- `_emit_human` now labels lines `error pkg: N error(s)` vs
  `warn pkg: N warning(s)` based on the highest severity present, instead
  of always saying "warn".
- `_skills/general/02_package_07_github-actions.md` corrected the CI
  failure-policy section: `continue-on-error: true` is forbidden (it
  hides the signal); merge-gating uses branch-protection required-checks
  instead.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `attach_shell_completion(group, *, prog_name)` helper for any click
  group to register `install-shell-completion` and
  `print-shell-completion` subcommands consistently.

### Fixed
- `<cli>` placeholder substitution in shell-completion help text.
